<!-- New topics:

    Paragraph tags, <p>
    Headings, level h1 to h6: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
        Headings of h1 are the overall heading of the webpage, and subsequent subcontent is headed with h2, nested under that is h3, and so on.
        Headings of similar importance share the same h-level
    Strong elements make text bold and importantly, they mark text semantically as important for assistive technologies and the like
    The emphasize element, <em>, makes text italic and marks it semantically to be seen as an emphasis
    Elements indented inside other element tags are called nested elements, like <p>This is a <em>nesting</em> element </p>
